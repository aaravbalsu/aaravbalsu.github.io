Howdy, I'm Aarav. I like looking at cool infosec exploits, reading philosophy, and collecting vintage Soviet space propaganda posters.
I got my B.S in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I'm getting an M.S. in Engineering Management at Northeastern University right now. I really started this as a way for me to document my OSCP l33t h4x0r journey, but I realize that it can serve a higher purpose: to educate others. Take that with a grain of salt though, since this website is part-technical-notebook and part-blog (so expect a lot of rambling!). In recognition of open-source information, I'm also tremendously inspired by and indebted to the wonderful infosec community that has always selflessly circulated troves of knowledge to us noobs, so a <b>massive</b> shout out to them. 

Here's a link to [my resume](/Northeastern%20Resume%2011.pdf) and <a href="https://github.com/aaravbalsu">my GitHub</a>.
