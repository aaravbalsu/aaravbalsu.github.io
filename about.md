Howdy, I'm Aarav. I like computers and amateur electronics, reading philosophy, and collecting vintage Soviet art (especially about their space program).

I was educated as an aerospace engineer (UIUC '17), then an operations researcher (read: mathematical optimization) (NEU '19), and I now work as a security consultant. 

I started this as a way for me to document both my technical learnings and to subject the denizens of the Internet to occasional ramblings.

I'm indebted to the infosec community (and the FOSS movement as whole) that has always selflessly curated and circulated troves of open-source knowledge for everyone, so a <u><b>massive</b></u> shout out to them. In that spirit, I hope this blog can serve others too.

Here's a link to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90067195-aarav-balsu">the books I read</a>, my [resume](/Northeastern%20Resume%2012.pdf) and my <a href="https://github.com/aaravbalsu">GitHub</a>.

If you want to get in touch with me, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/DoYouEvenBrown">Twitter</a> or email me at ping00 [at] protonmail [dot] com. My handle comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3BWUN24TJc">this delightful show </a> that I watched growing up.

Return from [whence](/README.md) you came.
