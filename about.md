o/ I'm Aarav. I like messing around with computers and amateur electronics, reading history and philosophy, and collecting vintage Soviet art (especially about their space program).

I was educated as an aerospace engineer (UIUC '17), then an operations researcher (read: mathematical optimization) (NEU '19), and I now work as a security consultant. 

I started this primarily to document my technical learnings, but I'm not opposed to subjecting the denizens of the Internet to  assorted and occasional ramblings.

I'm indebted to the infosec community (and the FOSS movement as a whole) that has always selflessly curated and circulated troves of open-source knowledge for everyone, so a <u><b>massive</b></u> shout out to them. In that spirit, I hope this blog can serve others too.

Here's a link to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90067195-aarav-balsu">the books I read</a>, my [resume](/Northeastern%20Resume%2012.pdf) and my <a href="https://github.com/aaravbalsu">GitHub</a>.

If you want to get in touch with me, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/DoYouEvenBrown">Twitter</a> or email me at ping00 [at] protonmail [dot] com. My handle comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3BWUN24TJc">this delightful show </a> that I watched growing up.

Return from [whence](/README.md) you came.
