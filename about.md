Howdy, I'm Aarav. I like looking at cool infosec exploits, reading philosophy, and collecting vintage Soviet space propaganda posters.
I studied aerospace engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and I'm studying engineering management at Northeastern University right now. I really started this as a way for me to document my OSCP l33t h4x0r journey, but I realize that it can serve a higher purpose: to educate others. Take that with a grain of salt though, since this website is part-technical-notebook and part-blog (so expect a lot of rambling!).  I'm also tremendously inspired by the wonderful infosec community that has always selflessly imparted troves and troves of knowledge to those of us who are still noobs, so a big shout out to them.
